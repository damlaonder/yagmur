# yagmur's website

this is a website I designed for my sister, Yagmur. she is a mechanical engineer at purdue university. 

when i started to teach myself how to design websites, she asked if i could could make her one that would showcase all of her academic projects and accomplishments so she could show recruiters what she is capable of. together, we talked about what colors she wanted, what features were important to her (e.g. the correct turkish spelling of her name), and how she wanted it organized. 

here is her website: https://damlaonder.github.io/yagmur/
